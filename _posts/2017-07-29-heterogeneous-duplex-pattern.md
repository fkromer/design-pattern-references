Other names: Heterogeneous Redundancy Pattern, Standby-Sparse Pattern, Dynamic Redundancy Pattern, Two-Channel Redundancy Pattern

It is a hardware pattern that is used to increase the safety and reliability of the system
by providing a heterogeneous replication for the required module to deal with the random and systematic faults.
